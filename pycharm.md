# PyCharm

PyCharm is a Python integrated development environment (IDE)
for Professional/Scientific/Educational developers and
contains plenty of must-have features.

The installation of PyCharm is optional. If you are not a Python developer or not interested
in installing a Python IDE, you can skip the installation and take the session as a demo.
If you install it, you will be able to follow the session by testing things out on your computer
during the session.


## Installation on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Please visit the [download and installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section) and install the
"Community" version of the software.

If you already have the PyCharm professional edition, no need to install the community edition.

## How to verify the installation

After the installation is complete, please make sure you can run the application.
